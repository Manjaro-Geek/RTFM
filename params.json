Use [Gist](http://gist.github.com/) or a [Pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) service;\r\n  * Make sure your code is syntatically correct;\r\n    * Use a linter or try to run it at least once;\r\n  * Avoid asking questions that are too broad; \r\n    * Like \"How do I make a Facebook clone?\";\r\n  * Avoid asking questions like \"Which [language|framework|Operating System|etc...] is the best; \r\n    * In the vast majority of cases there's no clear/right answer for questions like these;\r\n\r\n* While posting:\r\n  * Phrase your question objectively, but include as many details as possible.\r\n  * Be clear and write your question with the right use of the spoken language you're writing with.\r\n  * Don't be rude;\r\n\r\n* After posting:\r\n  * Be patient: No one has the duty to answer your question (Really, just like that)\r\n    * People are not being mean to you;\r\n    * They are not ignoring you;\r\n    * They may not know the answer;\r\n  * No begging;\r\n    * You're not the boss of anyone;\r\n    * Whining won't help;\r\n    * Taunting or being rude won't help either;\r\n    * Remember: People on [lists|forums|channels|etc...] don't work for you;\r\n  * No \"bumping\" your question;\r\n    * Read above;\r\n  * Don't argue with an answer without good reason for doing so;\r\n    * \"I don't like this answer\" is not a valid point;\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
